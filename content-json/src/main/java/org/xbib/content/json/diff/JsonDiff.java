/**
 * "Reverse" factorizing JSON Patch implementation.
 *
 * This class only has one method, {@link #asJson(com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode,
 * com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode)}, which
 * takes two JSON values as arguments and returns a patch as a {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode}.
 * This generated patch can then be used in {@link
 * org.xbib.content.json.patch.JsonPatch#fromJson(com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode)}.
 *
 * Numeric equivalence is respected. Operations are always generated in the
 * following order:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>additions,</li>
 * <li>removals,</li>
 * <li>replacements.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Array values generate operations in the order of elements. Factorizing is
 * done to merge add and remove into move operations and convert duplicate add
 * to copy operations if values are equivalent. No test operations are
 * generated (they don't really make sense for diffs anyway).
 *
 * Note that due to the way {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode} is implemented, this class is
 * inherently not thread safe (since {@code JsonNode} is mutable). It is
 * therefore the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the calling context
 * is safe (by ensuring, for instance, that only the diff operation has
 * references to the values to be diff'ed).
