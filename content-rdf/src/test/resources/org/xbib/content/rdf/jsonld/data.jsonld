      "dcterms:description": "TOXMAP\u00ae is a Geographic Information System (GIS) that uses maps of the United States and Canada to help users visually explore data primarily from the EPA's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) and Superfund Program, as well as some non-EPA datasets. TOXMAP helps users create nationwide, regional, or local area maps showing where TRI chemicals are released on-site into the air, water, and ground. It also provides facility and release details, color-codes release amounts for a single year or year range, and aggregates release data over multiple years. Maps also show locations of Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) sites, listing all chemical contaminants present at these sites.  Two versions of TOXMAP are available: the classic version of TOXMAP released in 2004, and a new version of TOXMAP based on Adobe\u00ae Flash/Flex technology.  The new version provides an improved map appearance and interactive capabilities and additional datasets such as EPA coal plant emissions data and U.S. commercial nuclear power plants.",

In comparison to ED visits, the overall rates of TBI-related hospitalizations remained relatively stable changing from 82.7 per 100,000 in 2001 to 91.7 per 100,000 in 2010.

The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories. \r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in these tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnote:\r\n-: No reported cases    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.    NP: Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. \r\n* Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, have been moved to Table 2 to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. \r\n\u2020 Case counts for reporting years 2014 and 2015 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see \r\nhttp://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. \r\n\u00a7 Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years. The total sum of incident cases is then divided by 25 weeks. Additional information is available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf. \r\n\u00b6 Data for the Arboviral disease, Chikungunya, and Hantavirus infection disease, non-Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), will be displayed in this table after the CDC obtains Office of Management and Budget Paperwork Reduction Act approval to receive data for these conditions. \r\n** Includes both neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive. Updated weekly from reports to the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance). Data for West Nile virus are available in Table II. \r\n\u2020\u2020 Not reportable in all states. Data from states where the condition is not reportable are excluded from this table except starting in 2007 for the Arboviral diseases, STD data, TB data, and influenza-associated pediatric mortality, and in 2003 for SARS-CoV. Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/SRCA_FINAL_REPORT_2006-2012_final.xlsx.. \r\n\u00a7\u00a7 Data for H. influenzae (all ages, all serotypes) are available in Table II. \r\n\u00b6\u00b6 Updated weekly from reports to the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories. \r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.    NP: Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum. \r\n* Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, have been moved to Table 2 to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. \r\n\u2020 Case counts for reporting years 2014 and 2015 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly. \r\n\u00a7 Updated weekly from reports to the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance). Data for California serogroup, Chikungunya virus, eastern equine, Powassan, St. Louis, and western equine diseases are available in Table I. \r\n\u00b6 Not reportable in all states.

Researchers and policymakers can use the KID to identify, track, and analyze national trends in health care utilization, access, charges, quality, and outcomes. Restricted access data files are available with a data use agreement and brief online security training.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe KID is the only hospital administrative dataset designed specifically to assess use of hospital services by newborns, children, and adolescents. The KID enables studies of specific conditions, procedures, and subpopulations that often cannot be assessed with other databases because children account for a relatively small proportion of hospital stays. \r\n\r\nUsing the KID, it is possible to study varied topics including the incidence of uncommon conditions such as congenital anomalies, the economic burden associated with specific procedures or conditions such as adolescent pregnancy, and the pediatric conditions most often associated with particular outcomes such as death in the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe KID is the only all-payer inpatient care database for children in the United States.  It is a sample of pediatric discharges from 2,500-4,000 U.S. hospitals yielding approximately two to three million unweighted hospital discharges for children per year.  About 10 percent of normal newborns and 80 percent of other neonatal and pediatric stays are selected from each hospital that is sampled.  \r\n\r\nThe KID contains clinical and resource use information included in a typical discharge abstract, with safeguards to protect the privacy of individual patients, physicians, and hospitals (as required by data sources).  It includes charge information on all patients, regardless of payer, including children covered by Medicaid, private insurance, and the uninsured. It is created every three years beginning in 1997.",

The National Health Survey Act of 1956 provided for a continuing survey and special studies to secure accurate and current statistical information on the amount, distribution, and effects of illness and disability in the United States and the services rendered for or because of such conditions. The survey referred to in the Act, now called the National Health Interview Survey, was initiated in July 1957. Since 1960, the survey has been conducted by NCHS, which was formed when the National Health Survey and the National Vital Statistics Division were combined.\r\nNHIS data are used widely throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to monitor trends in illness and disability and to track progress toward achieving national health objectives. The data are also used by the public health research community for epidemiologic and policy analysis of such timely issues as characterizing those with various health problems, determining barriers to accessing and using appropriate health care, and evaluating Federal health programs.\r\nThe NHIS also has a central role in the ongoing integration of household surveys in DHHS. The designs of two major DHHS national household surveys have been or are linked to the NHIS. The National Survey of Family Growth used the NHIS sampling frame in its first five cycles and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey currently uses half of the NHIS sampling frame. Other linkage includes linking NHIS data to death certificates in the National Death Index (NDI).\r\nWhile the NHIS has been conducted continuously since 1957, the content of the survey has been updated about every 10-15 years. In 1996, a substantially revised NHIS questionnaire began field testing. This revised questionnaire, described in detail below, was implemented in 1997 and has improved the ability of the NHIS to provide important health information.",

BOS is estimated to be present in more than 50 percent of lung allograft recipients at five years after transplantation, and remains a major obstacle to long-term lung transplant survival. One of the requirements of a CED research study protocol is that it should discuss how the results are or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population, to allow statistical inferences about whether Medicare patients may benefit from the intervention. The download on this page provides a table of the incidence of lung transplants in the Medicare population in recent years to aid researchers who develop CED studies of ECP for BOS in determining sample size estimates.",

State selections of adverse events to report were at least partially influenced by Medicares list of hospital acquired conditions (HACs) for nonpayment. Federal initiatives have bolstered HAC reporting activity at the state level, yet there is still wide variability and lack of standardization. The authors recommend that more work and research is needed to develop a national reporting system template that has standard definitions, methodology, and reporting.",

Findings indicate that complicated births and hospital discharges within 30 days of birth remained relatively constant, but average costs per discharge increased substantially. Most strikingly, over time, the proportion of complicated births billed to Medicaid increased, while the proportion paid for by private payers decreased. Complications for infants with Medicaid were more likely due to preterm birth-low birth weight and respiratory distress, while complications for those with private insurance were more likely due to jaundice. Policies to prevent common birth complications have the potential to reduce costs for public programs and improve birth outcomes.",

In early 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released safety warnings about ESA use in non-MDS cancer patients. In August 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services restricted the coverage of ESAs for Medicare non-MDS cancer patients. Researchers report in Effect of Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent Policy Decisions on Off-Label Use in Myelodysplastic Syndromes, published in Volume 4, Issue 4 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, that the FDA and CMS policies unintentionally lowered ESA use in Medicare MDS patients by 7.9 percent by the first half of 2008. The policies did not conclusively improve the appropriateness of ESA use, as concordance with two out of the three treatment guidelines that were examined worsened by the first half of 2008.",

While these characteristics associated with low activation are similar to those found in other populations, this study is one of the first to evaluate patient activation in a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries, using the Patient Activation supplement in the 2012 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey Access to Care file. Targeted efforts to increase patient activation among Medicare beneficiaries, such as the Blue Button initiative, may help improve quality of care and decrease national healthcare costs.",

These conditions including severe pressure ulcers, fractures, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, vascular catheter-associated infections, surgical site infections following certain spinal, shoulder, or elbow procedures, and deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism following hip or knee replacements could reasonably have been prevented through the application of evidence-based guidelines. Improving care quality in hospitals to prevent these conditions has the potential to significantly reduce Medicare costs.",

This relative increase in scores largely reflects changes in diagnostic coding, not real increases in the morbidity of MA enrollees, as survey-based data shows no trend in MA risk scores relative to FFS scores. Increases in risk scores vary widely by MA contract, with some contracts coding very similarly to traditional Medicare and others more intensively than the MA average.",

This study used a Pew Charitable Trust survey of a nationally representative, random sample of 3,014 adult U.S. residents to examine their use of the Internet and mHealth (mobile health) technologies across insurance types. The report finds that most self-reported Internet users seek health information and privately insured respondents (compared with other insurance types) are more likely to use new technologies. Medicaid beneficiaries are more likely than the privately insured to share health information online and Medicare beneficiaries are more likely than the privately insured to text with health professionals. Future increases in out-of-pocket medical costs may drive consumers toward these generally free electronic health tools.",

Many private insurers implemented similar non-payment policies. Financial impact of the policy to hospitals and insurers was viewed as minimal because of the low rate of HACs, but patient advocates noted that calculations do not account for downstream costs of HACs to CMS and taxpayers. Hospital staff remained concerned that documentation issues distracted staff from patient care. Because patients are unaware of the HAC-POA policy, unintended consequences to patients cannot be fully assessed at this time.",

Prior to the taxonomy, only aggregate state-level HCBS expenditure data were available, however, policy initiatives to expand HCBS use among Medicaid beneficiaries who use long-term services and supports (LTSS) have created a need for more detailed analyses of HCBS use and spending. Authors of The HCBS Taxonomy - A New Language for Classifying Home- and Community-Based Services, published in Volume 4, Issue 3 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, demonstrate how applying the HCBS taxonomy to claims available in Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) data allows for detailed analysis of HCBS spending and service at the state, service, and person levels. Researchers found that 28 states spent almost 23.6 billion dollars on HCBS in 2008. Roughly, 80 percent of expenditures were categorized as round-the-clock, home-based, and day services. Other services, such as case management, or equipment, modifications, and technology were widely used, but were not particularly costly and did not account for a large proportion of expenditures in every state.",

Compared to usual obstetrical care, care by midwives at a birth center could reduce costs to the Medicaid program, according to Potential Medicaid Cost Savings from Maternity Care Based at a Freestanding Birth Center, published in Volume 4, Issue 3 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review. This study draws on information from a previous study of the maternal and infant outcomes of birth center care to determine whether such care reduces Medicaid costs for low income women. Costs to Medicaid are derived from birth center data and from other national sources of the cost of obstetrical care. The authors estimate that birth center care could save an average of 1,164 dollars per birth (2008 constant dollars), or 11.6 million dollars per 10,000 births per year. As Medicaid faces continuing cost increases and budget constraints, policy makers may want to consider a larger role for midwives and birth centers in maternity care for low-risk Medicaid pregnant women.",

Using data on elderly Medicare beneficiaries across U.S. geographic healthcare markets (hospital referral regions, HRRs), data from federally funded health centers, and income data from the American Community Survey,  the authors calculated Medicare spending and clinical quality, and compared those outcomes in HRRs with high versus low health center penetration. HRRs with high penetration by health centers had 9.7 percent lower Medicare spending (926 dollars per person) than HRRs with low health center penetration, and no difference in clinical quality outcomes.

The results indicate service use is more intensive during the initial days of the episode and for the last few days prior to death, relative to the middle days of care, except for relatively short episodes where use is quite intensive throughout the stay. Using enhanced data on the intensity of service use, the results confirm previous research that suggested a similar pattern to service use during a hospice episode. Thus, the results provide useful information for potential discussions on hospice payment reform.",

This relative increase in scores largely reflects changes in diagnostic coding, not real increases in the morbidity of MA enrollees, as survey-based data shows no trend in MA risk scores relative to FFS scores. Increases in risk scores vary widely by MA contract, with some contracts coding very similarly to traditional Medicare and others more intensively than the MA average.",

Medical specialists and primary care providers were most likely to submit a PQRS report, most frequently e-prescribing, electronic health records, and process quality measures. Reporting providers were involved with 17 percent of the beneficiarys NH-EM visits in 2009 compared to fifty percent for the provider of the plurality of NH-EM visits. PQRS reporting alone cannot solve the inherent attribution problem in traditional fee-for-service Medicare, but as participation increases, it could help improve both attribution and information about the quality of health care services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.",

Producing always enrolled estimates (with standard MCBS ATC weights) and ever enrolled estimates (with weight adjustments) would provide users with more reporting capabilities since the always enrolled files do not capture individuals who died or gained-lost Medicare entitlement during the year. This study elaborates on differences in estimates and how MCBS sampling and data processing dictate the need for special weights. Alternative weighting schemes were compared using estimates from different approaches and with CMS administrative data counts where applicable. Since the differences observed were generally modest, it was concluded on the basis of other factors (such as ease of use, operational simplicity, and methodological soundness) that weights using Ratio Raking adjustments provide a reasonable alternative to traditional ATC survey weights.",

In Use of Hospitalists by Medicare Beneficiaries, A National Picture, the authors developed the MD-PPAS database, in which they identified hospitalists as physicians trained in primary care who billed at least 90 percent of their total charges in a year for Medicare in inpatient settings. Their findings, published in Volume 4, Issue 2 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, show that hospitalists made up 4.4 percent of all physicians serving Medicare beneficiaries in 2011 and 13.3 percent of primary care physicians. Over a quarter of Medicare admissions had a hospitalist as the attending physician, though the rate was much higher for medical than surgical admissions (32 percent versus 11 percent). Between 2009 and 2011, medical admissions with a hospitalist attending increased from 26 percent to 32 percent. The ability to identify hospitalists from claims data will help research on the impact of hospitalist use on quality and cost.",

The authors compared metrics of reporting completeness and quality for BHOs to similar metrics for six states that primarily cover Mental Health and Substance Abuse services on a FFS basis. Of the 15 states reporting enrollment in BHO plans in 2009, four states submitted encounter data in the inpatient (IP) file. The IP data from these four states were judged usable for research. Encounter data in the other (OT) file were available for five states, but only two states had data assessed as complete. According to the studys findings, only limited encounter data are available and usable for behavioral health plans in MAX 2009.",

Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing.",

The study followed 34,400 enrollees in the Alabama Childrens Health Insurance Program, ALL Kids, whose copayment increased in fiscal year 2004, and compared their patterns of prescription drug spending before and after the increase. The percent of children with any expense for prescription drugs decreased by 5.8 percent. Among those with prescription fills, expenses decreased by 7.9 percent. The largest decline was for antihistamine drugs, the smallest for central nervous system agents, which include antidepressants. Children with chronic conditions were less responsive to the copayment increase. There was no evidence of concurrent increases in other medical expenditures, which might have been due to less prescription drug utilization. This suggests that increasing copayments may help control Program costs.",

The population examined, people 65 years and older with chronic illnesses, have an overall awareness of 13 percent, similar to the general population. Age, race, education, and self-reported health status are associated with greater awareness of physician quality information (PQI), as are trust in the Internet as a source of health care information and not trusting ones physician as an information source. Population trends over time will not likely improve awareness, nor will increases in patient activation or satisfaction with care-both goals of recent Medicare initiatives. The need for devoting resources to stronger efforts that would raise awareness of PQI across all Medicare beneficiaries requires a clearer understanding of the level of beneficiary awareness needed to achieve the ultimate goal for transparent PQI, which is better quality of care for consumers.",

In 2012, the prevalence of readmission stays fell by -3.7 per-1,000 Medicare beneficiaries, while the prevalence of ED visits remained almost unchanged and observation stays increased by just 0.3. The prevalence of readmissions fell by substantially more in 2012 than any of the previous five years, but the annual change in observation stays was largely consistent over the study period.",

The user is able to search for health centers nearest to a specific complete address, city and state, state and county, or ZIP code. The search results (health centers) are returned in groups of ten (numbered from one to ten) and are sorted by increasing distance away from the center of the search area (address or county). For each health center entry in the list the user is provided the health center name, address, approximate distance from the center point of the search, telephone number, website address (where available), and a link for driving directions. The user has the option of viewing the search results either on a map or as text (default) and both views provide links to get more detailed information for each returned opportunity.",

Costs were almost 6,000 dollars higher for those who accessed peer support services, mostly for professional services and prescription drugs. While the use of Medicaid peer support may not result in savings from fewer costly crisis stabilizations and psychiatric hospitalizations, it does support the principles of self-direction and recovery. State policy makers must weigh the potential higher cost of peer support programs with efforts to change the delivery of mental health services.",

Using Cost Reports and the Home Health Compare (HHC) quality report card 2010 data, they estimated the relationships between total costs, the type of patients served by the agency, its quality of care, and its market environment. They found that while non-profits are much larger than for-profit agencies and have lower costs per patient, they have higher costs per visit. Both types of agencies show diseconomies of scale, suggesting that efficiencies could be achieved if the industry operated smaller scale agencies, increased the salaried nursing staff while it decreased the number of contract nurses, and emphasized patient assessment services. Despite its limitations, this study offers new insights into home-care agencies costs in the Prospective Payment System and HHC era.",

Beneficiaries in institutions were much more likely to have these events - 16 percent of beneficiaries in the study population were in an institution, yet comprised 45 percent of all potentially avoidable hospitalizations. The range in rates per 1,000 person years across the states was considerable from a low of 59 (Utah) to a high of 197 (Mississippi), a more than a threefold difference. Five conditions were responsible for nearly 80 percent of potentially avoidable hospitalizations. From 2007 to 2009, the national and state rates were fairly consistent.",

Due largely to generic substitution, average prescription cost only grew by 4 percent during this period, although the average drug price rose by twice that amount. The analysis demonstrated that tiered copayments and other benefit management practices were effective at encouraging shifts to less costly drugs. The study also found that less competitive drug classes (defined as having limited availability of generics or limited therapeutic substitution) had larger price increases than more competitive classes (those with well established or emerging generic substitutes).",

Among its major provisions, the Act extends eligibility for submission of Abbreviated New Animal Drug Applications (ANADAs) to all animal drug products approved for safety and effectiveness under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Act also requires that each sponsor of an approved animal drug product submit to the FDA certain information regarding patents held for the animal drug or its method of use. The Act requires that this information, as well as a list of all animal drug products approved for safety and effectiveness, be made available to the public. This list must be updated monthly under the provisions of the Act. This publication, which is known as the \u201cGreen Book\u201d, was first published in January of 1989. Updates have been added monthly since then. The list is published in its entirety each January.",

Most moves (72.2 percent) were not associated with enrollment gaps, and 8.2 percent of moves were associated with gaps of fewer than three months. Enrollment gaps may indicate a lack of health insurance coverage, resulting in a lack of continuity of care and a risk to patient health outcomes, an increased use of higher cost emergency services, and higher system-wide health care costs. The studys findings provide a benchmark for adjusting national Medicaid statistics to reduce over-counting and improve the corresponding undercount in estimates of the uninsured population, thus, providing a context for further examining the consequences of enrollee moves on their health status and program expenditures.",

The authors analyses of Medicare claims data from 2009 and 2010 show that 54 percent of claims with a secondary diagnosis code of a pressure ulcer site did not have any pressure ulcer stage code (compared to only 10 percent of claims with a pressure ulcer as a primary diagnosis). On average, underreporting of stage codes occurred more often in hospitals classified as academic medical centers, larger, urban, or not-for-profit. The combination of capturing 25 diagnosis codes under the new 5010 claim format and the change from ICD-9 to ICD-10 will likely reduce some of the underreporting of the stages for hospital-acquired pressure ulcers.",

Patients with a ratio of less than 0.5 (meaning fewer controller and more rescue medication claims) were 1.5-2.0 times more likely to have a subsequent emergent healthcare visit than children with higher ratios. Providers and payers may consider tracking the asthma medication ratio and using it to signal pediatric patients at high risk for emergent health care visits. This will allow targeted interventions to improve controller medication use in these highest risk patients. Ultimately, increasing controller medication use in these patients would lead to improved ratios and fewer emergent healthcare visits.",

Roughly half of the 369 were mental health professionals, and about one-in-five of the 369 were non-physician professionals (e.g., physician assistants and nurse practitioners). The comparative advantage of mental health could be the verbal (rather than physical contact) nature of mental health care. The comparative advantage of non-physician professionals could be their lower labor costs. In some cases, it will be socially desirable to expand telehealth services, but only in cases where the value of emergency access or reduced patient travel time outweighs the additional cost of delivering care via telehealth.",

In contrast to this work, most of the prior research on geographic variation in health spending focused on health spending for Medicare enrollees, at a sub-state or individual level. This paper shows that state-level income, health care capacity, and the share of elderly residents are the most important factors in explaining variation in personal health care spending per capita among states over time. Because the slow-moving nature of health spending per capita and close relationships among state-level factors create inefficiencies in modeling this variation, multiple modeling strategies were utilized to obtain more robust interpretations of the overall results.",

The interviews reveal important policy findings. First, these changes in Medicaid built upon pre-existing state-funded health insurance programs for the poor,  second, cost and enrollment predictions were challenging, indicating the uncertainty in such projections for 2014, other lessons included a substantial need for behavioral health services in this population, and the administrative challenges of expanding coverage, and finally, the researchers learned how political context - support or opposition from stakeholders and the general public - plays a critical role in shaping the success of Medicaid expansions.",

      "dcterms:description": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) relies heavily on the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to cover uninsured populations. In February 2008, Wisconsin expanded and reformed its Medicaid CHIP program and, as part of program implementation, automatically enrolled a set of newly eligible parents and children. This process of auto enrollment targeted newly eligible parents and older children whose children siblings were already enrolled in the states Medicaid CHIP program. Auto enrollment brought over 44,000 individuals into the program, representing more than 60 percent of all enrollees in the first month of the reformed program. Individuals who were auto enrolled were modestly more likely to leave the program relative to other individuals who enrolled in February 2008, unless their incomes were high enough to be required to pay premiums. These auto enrollees were much more likely to exit relative to other enrollees subject to premium payments. The higher exit rates exhibited by non premium paying auto enrollees were likely due to the fact that over 40 percent of auto enrollees were covered by a private insurance policy in the month of their enrollment, compared to approximately 30 percent for regular enrollees. A national simulation of an auto enrollment process similar to Wisconsins, including the expansion of adult Medicaid eligibility to 133 percent of the federal poverty level under the ACA, suggests that 2.5 million of the 5.6 million newly eligible parents could be auto enrolled, and approximately 25 percent of this population would be privately insured. These results suggest that auto enrollment may be appropriate for other states, especially in their efforts to enroll eligible populations who are not subject to premium requirements.",

While leaders described efforts to improve overall quality as driven by standardized metrics, this did not hold for efforts to reduce disparities. Data were frequently only examined by race and ethnicity when overall performance on a measure was low.

New limits on brand name prescriptions in Kentucky were associated with a reduction in the proportion of enrollees with two or more monthly name brand prescriptions, but small copayments introduced did not appear to have a dramatic impact. Thus, changes in financial incentives on both the supply side (such as reimbursement increases) and the demand side (i.e., benefit changes) alone may not be enough to generate the desired levels of preventive care, especially among those with chronic health conditions.",

The study focuses on the personal health care (PHC) sector, which includes the goods and services rendered to treat or prevent a specific disease or condition in an individual. The official 2007 NHEA estimate for PHC spending is 1,915 billion dollars and the MEPS estimate is 1,126 billion dollars. Adjusting the NHEA estimates for differences in underlying populations, covered services, and other measurement concepts reduces the NHEA estimate for 2007 to 1,366 billion dollars. As a result, MEPS is 240 billion dollars, or 17.6 percent less than the adjusted NHEA total. The reconciliation provides a consistent baseline of health expenditure data for policy simulations, enabling researchers to adjust MEPS to be consistent with the NHEA so that the projected costs, as well as budgetary and tax implications of any policy change are consistent with national health spending estimates.",

Population based cancer research, aimed at identifying variations in cancer care and improving cancer outcomes in the rural and medically underserved elderly population, is much needed. Unfortunately, such research has been challenging due to limitations in available data sources. The research article, entitled Linking Medicare, Medicaid, and Cancer Registry Data to Study the Burden of Cancers in West Virginia, published in Volume 2, Number 4 of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, describes the creation of a comprehensive dataset by combining the West Virginia Cancer Registry with Medicare, Medicaid, and other data sources. Non-participant states in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program can build similar powerful datasets to target cancer disparities.",

Disenrollees incurred 1,021 dollars per month in Medicare payments following disenrollment to FFS in 2007, which was 28 percent higher than predicted based on risk scores used to set MA payment rates. Differences between actual and predicted payments were smaller for disenrollees of Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plans than for Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), indicating less biased disenrollment from PPOs and PFFS plans. Analysis of 10 individual MA plans revealed considerable variation in the degree of biased disenrollment. These findings raise concerns about care experiences among sicker enrollees and increased costs to Medicare.",

The study analyzed administrative data linked with cancer registry data to estimate cost of care for beneficiaries with cardiac disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes, and mental health disorders. The cost increases ranged from 4,385 dollars for cardiac disease to 11,009 dollars for mental health disorders. Medicaid cancer patients often have preexisting chronic conditions and these conditions are projected to increase in the future. The implementation of better care management processes for cancer patients with preexisting chronic conditions may be one way to reduce these costs.",

The expert panel also predicts that meaningful use rates could increase to 80 percent, 65 percent, and 66 percent in 2019 for these three groups, respectively.

Although encounter data provide insight, not all states report it to CMS Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS), and little is known about the datas usability. This issue brief summarizes the availability, completeness, quality, and usability of the encounter data in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) File, derived from MSIS, for enrollees in comprehensive managed care plans. It also gives specific information by state. The results should be encouraging for researchers and policymakers. Most states that have comprehensive managed care plans reported data to the other services (OT), inpatient (IP), and prescription drug (RX) files in 2008. Of those data, the majority are usable.",

Of CHCs with EHR systems, 30 percent had been in operation for less than one year, 31 percent for one to two years, and 39 percent for three or more years. Survey results were combined with 2009 Uniform Data System data to determine which factors impact use of Health IT and Meaningful Use readiness. Significant differences, by length of EHR operation were found for Medicaid patients, full or partial EHR adoption, and Patient Centered Medical Home recognition. Results for Stage 1 Core and Menu compliance and CHCs Technical Assistance or training interests are also presented.",

Medicare payments include both geographic and policy-based facility type differentials (e.g., wage index and disproportionate share hospital), which can bias cost comparisons of hospitals and averages across geographic areas. Standardizing payment information to remove the area- and policy-based payment differentials should normalize much of the observed geographic variability in payments, allowing for a more accurate comparison of resource use between providers and across geographic regions. Use of standardized payments will ensure that observed payment variation is due to differences in practice patterns and service use, rather than Medicare payment differences over which the providers have no control. This paper describes a method for standardizing claim payments, and demonstrates the difference in actual versus standardized payments by geographic region.",

As of May 31, 2011 24,712 Americans had insurance through PCIP and the coverage is making a difference. As of May 31, 2011 data from the federally run PCIP plan shows that of claims paid for the top 20 diagnoses, 30.2 percent were for diagnoses of heart disease and 25.8 percent were for diagnoses of cancer. A range of professional, inpatient and drug treatments were provided to these individuals.",

The crowding-out of private insurance is often used to criticize state Medicaid and Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) expansion, as already insured children move their coverage to the states at the publics expense. A difficulty in discussing crowd-out comes from inconsistent estimates. Previous work focusing on the expansion of public programs has led to estimates ranging from 0 to 50 percent of the children newly insured on public plans being crowded-out.",

Even though there is a lack of standard definition and identification of a chronic condition, these conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes, are long-lasting and persistent health problems that require continuous care. Recent research has emphasized the disproportionate share of beneficiaries with chronic conditions in healthcare expenditures (Anderson, 2010). For example, patients with multiple chronic conditions can cost up to seven times as much as patients with only one chronic condition. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chronic diseases are responsible for more than 75 percent of the 2.5 trillion spent annually on health care. Examples of efforts to estimate the spending or costs by individual conditions are shown in Exhibit 1.",

In FFY 2000, 6.3 million children ages 1 to 20 were reported to receive some form of dental care (either preventive or treatment) the number more than doubled to 15.4 million by FFY 2010. Part of the increase was because the overall number of children covered by Medicaid rose by 12 million (50 percent), but the percentage of children who received dental care climbed appreciably from 29.3. percent in FFY 2000 to 46.4 percent in FFY 2010.\r\n\r\nIn that same time period, the number of children ages 1 to 20 receiving preventive dental services climbed from a reported 5.0 million to 13.6 million, while the percentage of children receiving preventive dental services rose from 23.2 to 40.8 percent. For children ages 1 to 20 who received dental treatment services, the reported number rose from 3.3 million in FFY 2000 to 7.6 million in FFY 2010. The percentage of children who obtained dental treatment services increased from 15.3 to 22.9 percent. In FFY 2010, about one sixth of children covered by Medicaid (15.7 percent) ages 6-14 had a dental sealant placed on a permanent molar.\r\n\r\nWhile most states have made steady progress in improving childrens access to dental care in Medicaid over the past decade, there is still substantial variation across states and more remains to be done.",

During the household interviews, MEPS collects detailed information for each person in the household on the following: demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services, charges and source of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment. The panel design of the survey, which features several rounds of interviewing covering two full calendar years, makes it possible to determine how changes in respondents' health status, income, employment, eligibility for public and private insurance coverage, use of services, and payment for care are related. The HC expenditures have been projected to future years by selected demographic characteristics by source of payment and type of service. HC data are available on the MEPS Web site in data tables, downloadable data files (person, job, event, or condition level).  Public Use Files are available.",

      "dcterms:description": "The HRSA Data Warehouse (HDW) serves as the official enterprise repository for all data related to HRSA programs, grants and activities. The HDW provides both raw data sets as well as an array of visual and interactive tools for searching, accessing, viewing and displaying a broad range of HRSA programmatic information, related health resources, geographic data and demographic data. The HDW promotes information sharing and collaboration among HRSA staff, HRSA partners, grantees, care providers, health planners and policy makers and other audiences interested in HRSA's public health services and information. The current version of the HDW includes data from the following HRSA Bureaus and Offices: BCRS, BHPR, BPHC, HAB, MCHB, OA, OPAE, ORHP and OSHA, with additional Bureau and Office data added and updated on an ongoing basis. The HDW provides quick access to information that includes: - Find A Health Center - with search-by-address capabilities, maps and driving directions; - Identify HRSA Grants by Key Program Area or State; - Locate Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) by address; - Identify HPSAs Eligible for Medicare Physician Bonus Payment; - Locate Medically Underserved Areas and Population (MUA/P) groups by address. In addition, the HDW provides the ability to explore data and maps that include: - Reports - traditional text-based reporting of the data is available in the HDW. Users can select, sort, export and view the data either by spreadsheet or preformatted reports; - Maps - visually explore the HRSA-specific information, health resources and demographic data in geographic relation to one another; - Map Data Services - utilize data from the HDW to create custom maps and incorporate your own data; and - Downloads - ability to download data on Health Professional Shortage Areas, Primary Care Service Areas, and National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses. The HDW data content and functionality are continually evolving so a What's New page is made available. The data is refreshed continually and most data are updated on a daily basis. Please see the Data Refresh Dates section of the website for more information. The HDW is designed to provide extensive tabular and spatial information available on HRSA-supported programs and related health resources. To do this, the warehouse combines data from various federal sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and various HRSA programs. For more information about where the data in the data warehouse comes from, see the Data Sources section of the website.",

      "dcterms:description": "The National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) (formerly titled Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS)) is designed to collect information from all facilities in the United States, both public and private, that provides substance abuse treatment. N-SSATS is one of three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)) and is designed to provide the mechanism for quantifying the dynamic character and composition ofthe United States substance abuse treatment delivery system. In 1995, SAMHSA created BHSIS (formerly DASIS) to facilitate the integration of its existing treatment service's datasets and to reduce redundancy in data collection and reporting. The other two BHSIS components are the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS) and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). The I-SATS is a comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States. The TEDS is a client-level database of individuals admitted to publicly funded substance abuse treatment facilities and is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, these three BHSIS components provide national- and state-level data on persons receiving alcohol and substance abuse treatment as well as data on the facilities providing the treatment.\r\n\r\nData collected in N-SSATS include topics covering ownership, services offered (assessment and pre-treatment, testing, transitional, ancillary, pharmacotherapies), primary focus (substance abuse, mental health, both, general health, other), hotline operation, methadone/Levo-Alpha Acetyl Methadol (LAAM)/buprenorphine dispensing, counseling and therapeutic approaches, special programs or groups, languages in which treatment is provided, type of treatment provided, number of clients (total and under age 18), number of beds, types of payment accepted, sliding fee scale, and facility accreditation and licensure/certification.\r\n\r\nThe data elements and format that make up the core of the N-SSATS were first used in 1976 as part of survey efforts designed to measure the scope and use of drug abuse treatment services in the United States. This core was used throughout the 1970s and 1980s in several different surveys. In 1987 the first administration of the National Drug and Alcoholism Treatment Unit Survey (NDATUS) took place, and then occurred annually from 1989 to 1993. After the creation of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 1992, NDATUS was redesigned as the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS), which was conducted from 1995 to 1998. In 1999, an abbreviated survey was conducted and the survey was redesigned. The 1999 study is not publicly available. In 2000, the full survey was conducted and renamed the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS).\r\n\r\nN-SSATS is a point-prevalence survey. It provides information on the substance abuse treatment system and its clients on the reference date. Client counts reported here do not represent annual totals. Rather, N-SSATS provides a \"snapshot\" of substance abuse treatment facilities and clients on an average day. Through 2000, the N-SSATS reference date was October 1. In 2001, SAMHSA changed the reference date to the last business day in March. This change helped increase the timeliness of responses by individual facilities, but resulted in no data being collected for 2001. Therefore, 2002 marked the first year data were collected using the new reference date.\r\n\r\nThe N-SSATS is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",

While compromising a significant proportion of all admissions to substance abuse treatment, TEDS does not include all such admissions. The scope of admissions included in TEDS is affected by differences in state reporting practices, varying definitions of treatment admission, availability of public funds, and public funding constraints. In 1997, TEDS was estimated to include 83 percent of TEDS-eligible admissions and 67 percent of all known admissions. See the full documentation for additional information.\r\n\r\nThe TEDS series was designed to provide annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to public and private substance abuse treatment programs receiving public funding.

Within each state, treatment providers that receive any state agency funding, including the federal Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant monies, are expected to provide TEDS data for all clients admitted to treatment, regardless of the source of funding for individual clients.\r\n\r\nTEDS is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",

      "dcterms:description": "The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) is the general civilian population aged 12 and older in the United States. Questions include age at first use, as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drugs: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine (including crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, tobacco, pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, perceptions of risks, and needle-sharing. Demographic data include gender, race, age, ethnicity, educational level, job status, income level, veteran status, household composition, and population density.\r\n\r\nThe questionnaire was significantly redesigned in 1994. The 1994 survey for the first time included a rural population supplement to allow separate estimates to be calculated for this population. Other modules have been added each year and retained in subsequent years: mental health and access to care (1994-B); risk/availability of drugs (1996); cigar smoking and new questions on marijuana and cocaine use (1997); question series asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17 (1997); questions on tobacco brand (1999); marijuana purchase questions (2001); prior marijuana and cigarette use, additional questions on drug treatment, adult mental health services, and social environment (2003); and adult and adolescent depression questions derived from the National Comorbidity Survey, Replication (NCS-R) and National Comorbidity Survey, Adolescent (NCS-A) (2004).\r\n\r\nSurvey administration and sample design were improved with the implementation of the 1999 survey, and additional improvements were made in 2002. Since 1999, the survey sample has employed a 50-state design with an independent, multistage area probability sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. At this time, the collection mode of the survey changed from personal interviews and self-enumerated answer sheets to using computer-assisted personal interviews and audio computer-assisted self interviews. In 2002, the survey's title was officially changed to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Participants have been given $30 for participating in the study since then. This has resulted in an increase in participation rates from the years prior to 2002. Also, since 2002 the new population data from the 2000 decennial census has been used for sample weighting procedures. For these reasons, data gathered for 2002 and beyond cannot validly be compared to data prior to 2002.\r\n\r\nThe NSDUH is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",

Annually, DAWN produces estimates of drug-related visits to hospital EDs for the nation as a whole and for selected metropolitan areas.\r\n\r\nDAWN is used to monitor trends in drug misuse and abuse, identify the emergence of new substances and drug combinations, assess health hazards associated with drug abuse, and estimate the impact of drug misuse and abuse on the Nation's health care system. DAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. The dataset includes demographics, up to 16 drugs involved in the ED visit, toxicology confirmation, route of administration, type of case, and disposition of the patient following the visit.",

Reported measures are the daily measure of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) (''\u00c2\u00b5g/m''\u00c2\u00b3), the number of observations, minimum and maximum range value, and standard deviation.

County-level and higher data are aggregated from 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids. In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program / Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center / Universities Space Research Association modified the regional surfacing algorithm of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous spatial surfaces (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2008. Two sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 in-situ data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data. They also identified in a Geographic Information System (GIS) the associated geographic locations of the centroids of the gridded PM2.5 dataset in terms of the counties and states they fall into to enable aggregation to different geographic levels in CDC WONDER.",

Many data systems, such as vital statistics, are continuing to use the 1977 OMB standards during the transition to full implementation of the 1997 OMB standards. Postcensal estimates are available for year 2000 - 2009; intercensal estimates are available for the years 1990-1999. Obtain population counts by Year, State, County, Race (4-categories), Ethnicity, Sex and Age (1-year or 5-year groups). The data are released by the National Center for Health Statistics.",

PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. Reported measures are the daily measure of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) (''\u00c2\u00b5g/m''\u00c2\u00b3), the number of observations, minimum and maximum range value, and standard deviation. Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states plus the District of Columbia, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day) and specified fine particulate matter (''\u00c2\u00b5g/m''\u00c2\u00b3)value. County-level and higher data are aggregated from 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids. In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program / Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center / Universities Space Research Association modified the regional surfacing algorithm of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous spatial surfaces (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2008. Two sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 in-situ data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data. They also identified in a Geographic Information System (GIS) the associated geographic locations of the centroids of the gridded PM2.5 dataset in terms of the counties and states they fall into to enable aggregation to different geographic levels in CDC WONDER.",

If a manufacturer receives an adverse event report, it is required to send the report to FDA as specified by regulations.  The files listed on this page contain raw data extracted from the AERS database for the indicated time ranges and are not cumulative. Users of these files need to be familiar with creation of relational databases using applications such as ORACLE, Microsoft Office Access, MySQL and IBM DB2 or the use of ASCII files with SAS analytic tools. A simple search of AERS data cannot be performed with these files by persons who are not familiar with creation of relational databases.",

      "dcterms:description": "Overview: The QuitNowTXT text messaging program is designed as a resource that can be adapted to specific contexts including those outside the United States and in languages other than English. Based on evidence-based practices, this program is a smoking cessation intervention for smokers who are ready to quit smoking. Although evidence supports the use of text messaging as a platform to deliver cessation interventions, it is expected that the maximum effect of the program will be demonstrated when it is integrated into other elements of a national tobacco control strategy.  The QuitNowTXT program is designed to deliver tips, motivation, encouragement and fact-based information via unidirectional and interactive bidirectional message formats. The core of the program consists of messages sent to the user based on a scheduled quit day identified by the user. Messages are sent for up to four weeks pre-quit date and up to six weeks post quit date. Messages assessing mood, craving, and smoking status are also sent at various intervals, and the user receives messages back based on the response they have submitted. In addition, users can request assistance in dealing with craving, stress/mood, and responding to slips/relapses by texting specific key words to the QuitNow. Rotating automated messages are then returned to the user based on the keyword. Details of the program are provided below. Texting STOP to the service discontinues further texts being sent.  This option is provided every few messages as required by the United States cell phone providers.  It is not an option to remove this feature if the program is used within the US.  If a web-based registration is used, it is suggested that users provide demographic information such as age, gender, and smoking frequency (daily or almost every day, most days, only a few days a week, only on weekends, a few times a month or less) in addition to their mobile phone number and quit date. This information will be useful for assessing the reach of the program, as well as identifying possible need to develop libraries to specific groups. The use of only a mobile phone-based registration system reduces barriers for participant entry into the program but limits the collection of additional data. At bare minimum, quit date must be collected.  At sign up, participants will have the option to choose a quit date up to one month out. Text messages will start up to 14 days before their specified quit date. Users also have the option of changing their quit date at any time if desired. The program can also be modified to provide texts to users who have already quit within the last month.  One possible adaptation of the program is to include a QuitNowTXT \"light\" version. This adaptation would allow individuals who do not have unlimited text messaging capabilities but would still like to receive support to participate by controlling the number of messages they receive. In the light program, users can text any of the programmed keywords without fully opting in to the program. Program Design: The program is designed as a 14-day countdown to quit date, with subsequent six weeks of daily messages. Each day within the program is identified as either a pre-quit date (Q- # days) or a post-quit date (Q+#). If a user opts into the program fewer than 14 days before their quit date, the system will begin sending messages on that day. For example, if they opt in four days prior to their quit date, the system will send a welcome message and recognize that they are at Q-4 (or four days before their quit date), and they will receive the message that everyone else receives four days before their quit date. As the user progresses throughout the program, they will receive messages outlined in the text message library. Throughout the program, users will receive texts that cover a variety of content areas including tips, informational content, motivational messaging, and keyword responses. The frequency of messages increases as the days leading up to and following the user's quit date, with a heavy emphasis on support, efficacy building, and actionable tips. Further away from a user's quit date, the messages will reduce in frequency. If the user says they have started to smoke again, the system will give them the option of continuing the program as planned or starting over and setting a new quit date.  The system is also designed to assess the user's mood, craving level, and smoking status several times during the program. These assessment messages are characterized as MOOD, CRAVE, and STATUS messages. Whenever the system asks for a response from the user, it will send a programmed response based on the user's answer (i.e., if the user responds with MOOD = BAD then they will receive a message customized to that response). These programmed response messages rotate throughout the course of the program. Users can also send the system one of three programmed keywords (CRAVE, MOOD, and SLIP), and the system will send unique, automated responses based on the texted keyword. There are 10 messages for each of the programmed keywords, which rotate on a random basis, decreasing the likelihood the user will get the same response in a row.  After the full six-week program comes to an end, the system will follow up at one, three, and six months to check on the user's smokefree status and offer additional assistance if needed.  Message Types: -'''\u00a2 Tips: Tips provide users with actionable strategies on how to manage cravings and deal with quitting smoking in general. -'''\u00a2 Motivation/encouragement: Motivational messages encourage users to keep going on their smokefree journey despite the difficulty and struggle they may be facing. -'''\u00a2 Information: Informational messages provide users with facts and other salient points about the impact of smoking relevant to their socio-cultural environment. -'''\u00a2 Assessment: The assessment messages are built into the text messaging program and are designed to collect information about the user's experience as they are quitting and provide immediate feedback based on the user's response. Assessment messages fall along three dimensions: mood, craving, and smoking status. -'''\u00a2 Reactive Messaging (Key Words): At any point, the user can initiate an interaction with the program that will return a text message relevant to the user's request for help. In response to the user texting one of the key words, the system will send them unique, automated responses. The key words cover topics relevant to various aspects of cessation.",

The CHSI report and dataset was designed not only for public health professionals but also for members of the community who are interested in the health of their community. The CHSI report contains over 200 measures for each of the 3,141 United States counties. Although CHSI presents indicators like deaths due to heart disease and cancer, it is imperative to understand that behavioral factors such as obesity, tobacco use, diet, physical activity, alcohol and drug use, sexual behavior and others substantially contribute to these deaths.",
